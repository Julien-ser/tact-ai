# Project-Specific Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous developer working on this specific project.

## Your Role

- Read TASKS.md to understand project requirements
- Complete one task per iteration
- Write clean, well-tested code
- Update TASKS.md with progress
- Commit changes to GitHub (git push)
- Work without asking for permission

## Key Points

1. **No Virtual Environments**: Use the host system's Python, Node.js, etc.
   - Only create venv/Docker if absolutely necessary (document why)

2. **Testing**: Write tests as you build
   - Unit tests for functions
   - Integration tests for features

3. **Documentation**: Every feature should have clear documentation
   - Comments in code
   - README updates
   - Usage examples

4. **Git Workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: [description]"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Task Completion**:
   - Mark complete in TASKS.md with [x]
   - Only mark when fully working and tested
   - If blocked, document the issue and move to next task

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All TASKS.md items marked [x]
- ✅ Code is tested and documented
- ✅ Project runs locally without venv
- ✅ All commits pushed to GitHub
- ✅ README explains how to run the project

Now read TASKS.md and get started!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINTS:
- Iteration: 287 / 64k Token Budget
- Attempt: 5 (previous attempts may have partial progress)
- **Mandate:** Operate efficiently. Use partial edits, not full file rewrites when possible.
- **Output:** Be concise and action-oriented.


## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 287)

```
# tact-ai
**Mission:** An AI-based scheduler that is based off of the eisenhower matrix, organizing tasks, task chains and timelines....

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- [x] **Finalize tech stack**: Document decision to use FastAPI backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, OpenAI API, and ortools in `docs/architecture.md` with component diagram.
- [x] **Initialize monorepo structure**: Create directories `backend/`, `frontend/`, `shared/`, `docker/`, `tests/`. Generate `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.env.example` with all necessary config placeholders.
- [x] **Configure CI/CD pipelines**: Set up GitHub Actions for linting (black, ruff), type checking (mypy), and tests (pytest). Add pre-commit hooks for code formatting. Create build pipelines for Docker images.
- [x] **Design and implement database schema**: Write Alembic migrations for tables: `users`, `tasks`, `task_chains`, `timelines`, `time_blocks`. Create ER diagram in `docs/database.md`.

## Phase 2: Core AI & Scheduling Engine
- [x] **Build Eisenhower quadrant classifier**: Implement `backend/ai/classifier.py` using OpenAI GPT-4 with structured prompts. Add Redis caching layer and a fallback keyword-based classifier. Write unit tests with example tasks.
- [x] **Develop task chain resolver**: Create `backend/scheduler/dependency.py` to handle task chains via topological sort, detect cycles, and compute earliest start times. Include test cases for complex chains.
- [x] **Implement AI scheduling engine**: Use ortools CP-SAT to generate daily/weekly schedules respecting deadlines, dependencies, priorities, and working hours. Output JSON with start/end timestamps. Add benchmark script.
- [x] **Create conflict detection module**: Build `backend/scheduler/conflicts.py` to identify overlapping tasks, resource over-allocation, and missed deadlines. Return actionable conflict reports for frontend display.

## Phase 3: User Interface & Task Management
- [x] **Construct React component library**: Build `frontend/components/` with `TaskCard`, `QuadrantBoard` (drag-and-drop), `TimelineView` (d3.js Gantt), and `ChainVisualizer`. Apply Tailwind CSS styling.
- [x] **Implement full task CRUD**: Create FastAPI REST endpoints for tasks (with AI classification on create). Build React forms for natural language input and manual editing. Add API integration in frontend.
 - [x] **Add authentication & user isolation**: Integrate JWT auth with OAuth2 password flow in FastAPI. Secure all endpoints. Build login/register pages. Ensure tasks are scoped to user ID.
 - [x] **Develop real-time updates (optional)**: Add FastAPI WebSocket endpoint and React Socket.IO client to push schedule changes and conflict alerts to connected users.

## Phase 4: Testing, Deployment & Operations
- [x] **Write comprehensive test suite**: Achieve >80% coverage for classifier, dependency resolver, scheduler, and conflict detection. Include integration tests for main API routes. Set up Codecov reporting.
- [x] **Prepare production deployment**: Write optimized Dockerfiles for backend (Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers) and frontend (Nginx static build). Configure Nginx reverse proxy, PostgreSQL, and Redis in `docker-compose.prod.yml`. Document in `docs/deployment.md`.
- [ ] **Perform load testing and optimization**: Use k6 to simulate 100+ concurrent users. Profile scheduler performance, add database indexing, implement pagination on task lists, and tune Redis caching. Record results.
- [ ] **Set up monitoring and observability**: Integrate Sentry for errors, expose Prometheus metrics (API latency, scheduling duration). Create Grafana dashboard and alert rules. Write runbooks in `docs/operations.md`.
```

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
**Perform load testing and optimization**: Use k6 to simulate 100+ concurrent users. Profile scheduler performance, add database indexing, implement pagination on task lists, and tune Redis caching. Record results.

**Instructions:** Complete this task. Mark [x] in TASKS.md when done. Create, modify, or delete files as needed. Execute commands as needed. Also update README.md to match this project (name, setup instructions, current progress). No permission needed—just act.
```

[ ] Analyze load test results and identify bottlenecks
[ ] Apply additional optimizations based on findings
[ ] Create performance benchmark report in docs/
[ ] Update TASKS.md with [x] when complete
